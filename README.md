# Road Accident Analysis

A comprehensive analysis of road accident data to identify key factors contributing to accidents and provide insights for safety improvements.

## Introduction

This project involves the analysis of a road accident dataset, aiming to identify patterns and factors influencing accidents. The dataset includes information on accident status, vehicle and casualty references, demographics, and severity of casualties and so on.

## Features

- Data Cleaning: Utilized Python for data cleaning, handling missing values, and outliers.
- Statistical Analysis: you can do Statistical Analysis by yuning [Daneshkar_Project1.ipynb]
- Machine Learning: Employed Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Decision Tree, and Deep Neural Network algorithms to identify key features contributing to accidents.
- Recommendations: Derived insights to make recommendations for road safety improvements based on the analysis.
